## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to exploring and documenting the process of requirement analysis in software development projects. Requirement analysis is a crucial phase in the software development lifecycle where the needs and expectations of stakeholders are gathered, analyzed, and clearly defined to guide the development process.

In this repository, youâ€™ll find structured notes, examples, templates, and resources aimed at understanding the importance of effective requirement analysis and how it contributes to building successful software solutions.
## What is Requirement Analysis?
